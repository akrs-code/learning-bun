# 🧪 Learning Bun

This repository is my personal exploration of **Bun**, a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager.

The goal of this project is to learn how Bun works, compare it with Node.js, and experiment with its features through small demos, scripts, and mini-projects.
